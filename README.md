# Hi, I'm Fluffy Flower 🐾

![Fluffy Flower](Images/Fluffy_Icon.jpg)

I’m a backend and systems-focused developer. I work with Python, Java, Bash, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, and I can jump back into any of these languages quickly if needed. My favourites are Python and Java. I like to make systems work reliably first. GUIs come later, and when I do make them, they’re usually barebones. Function over form is my style.

I code in a mix of procedural and object-oriented approaches, keeping things explicit and easy to follow. I plan most systems carefully, sketching out the complex parts with UML in tools like Visual Paradigm before building them. I also like to think ahead about potential pitfalls, which saves a lot of debugging later even if it slows me down a bit sometimes.

I’ve worked on projects like a 3D Linux settings manager that mirrors Nvidia’s control panel on Windows. It integrates with DXVK and vkBasalt, manages persistent configuration files, and handles complex system-level interactions. I use libraries like PyQt6 for GUIs, and for web stuff I’ve dabbled with React and Vue, but I try to keep things simple and readable, avoiding unnecessary abstraction whenever possible.

Basically, I like clear, reliable, step-by-step code. I enjoy building systems that just work, and thinking through problems from the ground up. Whether it’s automation, game tooling, or system optimization, I focus on making tools that are solid, maintainable, and easy to understand.
