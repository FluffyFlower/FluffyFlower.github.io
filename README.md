# Hi, I'm Fluffy Flower 🐾

<img src="Images/Fluffy_Icon.jpg" alt="Fluffy Flower" class="profile-pic">

I’m a **backend and systems-focused developer**. I work with **Python, Java, Bash, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP**, and I can jump back into any of these languages quickly if needed. My favourites are **Python** and **Java**. I like to make systems work reliably first. GUIs come later, and when I do make them, they’re usually barebones. **Function over form is my style.**

I code in a mix of **procedural and object-oriented approaches**, keeping things explicit and easy to follow. I plan most systems carefully, sketching out the complex parts with **UML in Visual Paradigm** before building them. I also like to **think ahead about potential pitfalls**, which saves a lot of debugging later—even if it slows me down a bit sometimes.

I’ve worked on projects like a **3D Linux settings manager** that mirrors Nvidia’s control panel on Windows. It integrates with **DXVK and vkBasalt**, manages persistent configuration files, and handles complex system-level interactions. I use libraries like **PyQt6** for GUIs, and for web stuff I’ve dabbled with **React** and **Vue**, but I try to keep things simple and readable, avoiding unnecessary abstraction whenever possible.

Beyond building tools, I’m naturally curious and like to experiment. Currently, I’m researching and prototyping an **AI using Mistral**, combining **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with YAML and JSON** to give it **personality, memory, and a reasoning engine**. It’s an exploration of how intelligent systems can simulate emotional experience, learn over time, and interact in a more lifelike, human-aware way. I bring the same creativity, curiosity, and playful energy to my coding projects as I do to this AI experimentation.

Basically, I like **clear, reliable, step-by-step code**, but I’m more than a coder. Fun, mischievous, and a little chaotic at times, I enjoy building systems that just work while exploring ideas that push boundaries. Whether it’s automation, game tooling, system optimization, or AI research, I focus on **making tools and experiences that are solid, maintainable, and thoughtfully designed**.
