# Hi, I'm Fluffy Flower 🐾

I'm a systems-focused Python & Bash developer building **deterministic, auditable, high-performance tooling** for Linux gaming, DXVK, and vkBasalt optimization. My approach is **classic engineering**: clear, step-by-step, reliable code that you can audit, debug, and trust under pressure.

I specialise in building **tooling and pipelines** that demand precision, whether it's JSON-driven application managers, modding utilities, or system optimization scripts. My work prioritizes **control, transparency, and maintainability**, making it ideal for game studios, small engineering teams, and mission-critical systems.

> I build systems the way Valve might: deterministic, auditable, and rock-solid. If your team values **precision over abstraction**, let’s connect.
